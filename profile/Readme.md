# Open Cluster Scheduler

We are pleased to announce that we will continue the development of the Univa Open Core Grid Engine, which in
turn is based on the open source Sun Grid Engine originally published by Sun Microsystems. Renamed
"Open Cluster Scheduler", this project will remain open source under the SISSL v2 licence, with the source code
available here.

In addition to maintaining the open source version, we will introduce advanced features under the name
"Gridware Cluster Scheduler". This iteration will be offered with commercial support and consulting services from
HPC-Gridware GmbH. The new features will be released under the Apache Licence v2.0.

## Code Repository

Our main code repository for the Open Cluster Scheduler is hosted on GitHub and can be accessed here:

- [Open Cluster Scheduler Repository](https://github.com/hpc-gridware/clusterscheduler)

## Choosing the Code Base

After careful consideration, we have selected the Univa code base as our foundation. Despite the availability of
alternatives like Open Grid Scheduler and Some/Son of Grid Engine, the Univa version aligns best with our goal of
making significant codebase improvements. Our inaugural release — version 9.0.0 — will mark a modernization effort,
aligned with the ongoing growth in HPC and AI workloads which demand faster, more flexible computing clusters.

Technological advancements in CPU and GPU design necessitate advanced decision-making algorithms for schedulers.
We aim to tackle these challenges, ensuring the Cluster Scheduler codebase can effectively support modern
multi-core CPUs, GPUs, NPUs, and FPGAs.
